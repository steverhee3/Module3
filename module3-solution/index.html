As I’ve learned from years of blogging, long-form content is one of the best methods of making your site stand out from everyone else’s.
Of course, your content can’t just be long. It also has to be deep.
If you can nail it, you’ll drive a ton of traffic and gain thousands of followers
A lot of people think the formula is simple.
Step 1:  Write a really long article.
Step 2:  Get thousands of followers.
But here’s the thing. A long-form blog post isn’t enough on its own.
Yes, the formula is simple, but it doesn’t work automatically just because you have a long article.
I’ve seen lots of people write super long, in-depth articles, but they’re not getting the kind of traffic they want.
That’s because they’re not thinking about some of the fundamental elements of SEO — things that your long-form blog post needs.
If you have detailed long-form content, that’s awesome. But you need to doctor it up with SEO in mind if you want the content to be effective.
Trust me, I know this can be difficult. You’re already putting a lot of effort into the content, and it’s hard to remember all of the SEO involved.
So I compiled this list to help you out. These are 27 SEO must-haves for every long-form article.
They’ll help your content rank better, get more visibility, and drive traffic to your site.
Best of all, these steps aren’t hard to use at all. Even if you don’t know anything about SEO, you can use every single one of these tips.
Open your latest blog post, grab a coffee, and get ready to transform your content.
